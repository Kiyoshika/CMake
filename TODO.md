# TODO
* Improve matrix multiplication speed - currently using the naive implementation
    * the main idea is to break up large matrices into much smaller ones and merge them all together in one matrix
* implement functionality for subsetting and sampling matrices
* implement arithmetic for scalars for both matrices and vectors
* implement functions to add/subtract/multiply/divide vectors and matrices element-wise
* matrix determinants + inversion
* eigen vectors & eigen values
